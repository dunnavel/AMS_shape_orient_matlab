# AMS_shape_orient_matlab
This repository contains Matlab code that calculates snow aggregates distribution functions, bulk fall speed quantities, and self-collection quantities used in the Journal of the Atmospheric Science (JAS) article entitle: "How Snow Aggregate Shape and Orientation Variability Affects Fall Speed and Self-Collection Rates." The relevant mathematical details that describe the H-function distribution function forms and bulk fall speed quantities and self-collection rate equations can be found in the Supplementary Materials section of that article. Additional Matlab code is provided for calculating Fox's H-function through numerical integration of the H-function Mellin-Barnes integral representation (see Supplementary Materials section for more details). This function (Fox_H.m) comes from the article: "Performance Analysis of M-QAM Multihop Relaying over mmWave Weibull Fading Channels", Soulimani et al. 2016" but modified slightly to incorporate array inputs.  Bulk fall speed quantities (i.e., number-, mass-, and reflectivity-weighted fall speeds) can be computed exactly using the integration properties of the H-function; that is, integral quantities are explicitly described in terms of ratios of gamma functions. Self-collection rates are estimated by sampling from the individual probability density functions for size and shape.
